Masking Demonstration
---------------------
This HTML5 app implements a simple demonstration of two tone masking
in human hearing. A reference / masking tone is played at a specific
frequency chosen by user input an a secondary tone with frequency 
relative to the reference tone is also chosen by the user along with
the playback level relative to the reference tone. The user can thereby
listen to the two tones and hear the effect of masking. The user is 
also able to plot there findings to build a masking profile for their
own hearing.
